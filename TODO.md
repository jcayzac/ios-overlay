##Dependencies
__boost__ depends on __bzip2__. I have added a <code>DEPEND=bzip2</code> variable in boost's build script, but currently it is not used. I should probably write a small dependency-checking script.

##Documentation
TODO: write this to-do. Just jokingâ€¦

##Universal static libraries
Do we want them? Some library could have automatically generated public headers depending on the platform.
